# EDA And Customer Segmentation of E-commerce data

This project uses a translational data set that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Each row in the dataset represents the transaction that occurs. It includes the product name, quantity, price, and other columns that represent the ID. The aim is to cluster customers on segments based on their behavior. This project is a visualization project in Tableau in order to understand the customer segments visually and draw conclusions from the same.
